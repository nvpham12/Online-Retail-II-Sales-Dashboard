/*
This query:
  - Combines data from two Excel sheets (saved as CSV files and loaded into BigQuery as separate tables) using UNION ALL
  - Defines the result as a Common Table Expression (CTE) for further processing
  - Removes currency and converts Price into a numerical column, UnitPrice
  - Calculates total Sales per row (Unit_Price Ã— Quantity)
  - Removes duplicates using SELECT DISTINCT
  - Creates an InvoiceDate_UTC column
  - Removes UTC suffix from all invoice dates and renames column to InvoiceTimeStamp_UTC
  - Removes rows with non-positive Quantities, nulls, invalid Countries, and canceled orders (where Invoice starts with 'C')
  - Creates a new table that contains the resulting dataset
  - Processes 92.97 MB of data

It differs from the baseline query in that this query:
  - Lists out all columns instead of using SELECT *
  - Filters the data from the sheets first instead of filtering the union CTE
  - Uses UNION ALL instead of UNION DISTINCT, reducing redundant deduplication (SELECT DISTINCT is used later)
  - Finds UnitPrices without a subquery
