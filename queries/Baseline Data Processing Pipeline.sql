/*
This query:
  - Combines data from two Excel sheets (saved as CSV files and loaded into BigQuery as separate tables) using UNION DISTINCT
  - Defines the result as a Common Table Expression (CTE) for further processing
  - Creates an InvoiceDate_UTC column
  - Removes UTC suffix from all invoice dates and renames column to InvoiceTimeStamp_UTC
  - Converts Price into a numerical Unit_Price
  - Calculates total Sales per row (Unit_Price Ã— Quantity)
  - Removes any duplicates using SELECT DISTINCT
  - Removes rows with non-positive Quantities, nulls, invalid Countries, and canceled orders (where Invoice starts with 'C')
  - Creates a new table that contains the resulting dataset
  - Processes 92.97 MB of data
